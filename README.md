# 7zip-extraction-Bash-script-
This script extracts multiple 7z archives into their designated subfolders.

Now, this script isn't perfect, it uses ls for parsing archive names (bad idea), but for now it gets the job done. Note that I am still a Bash script noobie, haven't written much shell code lately...
Feel free to use this for learning to do similar things or to use it on your own system, but do not take credit for it!
